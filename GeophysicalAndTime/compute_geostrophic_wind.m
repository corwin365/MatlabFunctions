%compute geostrophic wind from GPH data
%
%implements u = -(g/f) .* (dZ./dy)
%and        v = -(g/f) .* (dZ./dx)
%
%
%Inputs:
%  Data - struct, containing:
%     GPH       [nlats x nlons x [arbitrary higher dimensions]] : geopotential HEIGHT
%     LonScale  [nlons]                                         : longitude (degrees)
%     LatScale  [nlats]                                         : latitude  (degrees)
%  NoWrap - if set to 1, longitudes are **not** assumed to wrap (useful for subglobal regions)
%         - to be clear, BY DEFAULT LONGITUDES ARE ASSUMED TO WRAP
%
%
%Outputs:
%     u     [nlats   x nlons-1 x [arbitrary higher dimensions]] : zonal wind 
%     v     [nlats-1 x nlons   x [arbitrary higher dimensions]] : meridional wind 
%     u_lat [nlats-1]                                           : shifted latitude  grid for u
%     v_lon [nlons-1]                                           : shifted longitude grid for v
